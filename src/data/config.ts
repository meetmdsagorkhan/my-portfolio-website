    long: "I am a Customer Experience Leader with hands-on experience building and scaling high-performing CX operations for fast-growing digital platforms. Currently leading Customer Experience at Priyo Pay, I manage onboarding, support, automation, and cross-functional issue resolution for thousands of freelancers and businesses handling international payments. My work focuses on improving CSAT, SLA compliance, retention, and operational efficiency through structured processes, CX automation (n8n, AI agents), and data-driven performance frameworks. I have led and coached CX teams, built SOPs and knowledge bases, and partnered closely with Product, Risk, and Compliance teams to resolve high-impact KYC and AML cases quickly and accurately. Previously, I have managed large learner and client ecosystems in ed-tech and e-commerce environments, supporting over 5,000 users, improving response times to under one hour, and driving measurable gains in retention, revenue, and satisfaction. I am passionate about turning customer feedback into scalable systems that create trust, speed, and consistently great experiences.",
